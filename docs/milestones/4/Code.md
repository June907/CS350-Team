### Milestone 4. Functionality Complete



Role: Programmer - Code

Goal: Write code - core features

* ~~Implement User Stories~~
* ~~Test-driven workflow~~
* ~~Implementation Cycle - Test, Fix, Extend, Improve~~
* ~~Implement all core features~~



## Easel - Write code - core features



### Implement User Stories



### Test-driven workflow
For testing, please login to TestUser, password as testingeasel. After you login you can be redireact to a studentPage, from there you can sign up classes using the course button on the left hand side menu(for now please sign up to TestClass). After you sigin up for a class, you can go to the class page from there you can go to discussion board to create you discussion. For assignment, you have to go to /assignment to see what assignment you have created, and go to /assignment/new to create a new assignment.

### Implementation Cycle - Test, Fix, Extend, Improve
For test-driven, we have created a test course under the Easel project to test if we can create a class successfully, moving on, we also created test discussion board to see if the CURD is working for all the discussion views. All the features above are implement successfully with test. However, creating an assignment for professor still returns error, and turn in assignment for students are still a issue, it will be fixed in the next milestone. 


### Implement all core features
