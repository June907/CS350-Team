- ~~Flesh out login/logout functionality~~
- ~~Full CRUD implementation of basic classes~~

CURRENT PROGRESS: More work needs to be done to flesh out the url structure of any given Course, but Students/Professors are able to perform most tasks specific
to their role's CRUD permissions. Development is on-track, though much more work needs to be completed to make our application deliverable.
