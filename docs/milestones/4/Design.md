### Milestone 5 - Customer Acceptance Approval



Role: Programmer - Design

Goal: Oversee Code and Test Completion

* ~~Document Existing Design Patterns~~
* ~~Document key APIs~~
* ~~Build import/export for data~~

## Document Existing Design Patterns

* Design patters can be found through the do

  
## Document key APIs

* The interfaces we thought would be most important was the student and teacher view, giving a quick and easy way to design assignments and discussions

## Build import/export for data

* database and account data is used through sqlite and django admin.  Classes assignments and discussions are all ran through databases, and while they cant be imported they are kept track of through the django users app.
  
Overall, the website's core functionality is complete, and most remaining work will go into fleshing out the application to create a finished product.
