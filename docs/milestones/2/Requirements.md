### Milestone 2. Technology Proven



Role: Project Manager - Requirements

Goal: Setup communications

* Configure communication tools
* Team communication
* Plan daily meetings



## Book Builder - Setup communications



### Configure communication tools
We set up a discord server immediately after groups were assigned. Currently the server has one text channel and one voice channel. Additional channels will be added if necessary but this is unlikely.

### Team communication
All communication is done through the Discord server

### Plan daily meetings
The group has a standing plan to meet after each class session. This is either a quick text chat to ask questions and go over what we should be doing, or a longer voice chat to discuss things more in depth.
