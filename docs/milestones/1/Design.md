-------       Select Development Tools      --------

The development tools below were selected based on what was decided on by the whole team, based on the programs capabilities of the tools and the familiarity of the programmers that will be using them:
 - Django/Python
 - Html/CSS/Javascript
 - Visual Studio
 - Github
 - Heroku


------- Infrastructure - Frameworks & Tools --------

Using Django, our team should be able to work together to incorperate aspects of the other tools to put together a project that will be very special.  Our unique take on Canvas, named Easel, is planned to provide tools to conduct an online course, course managment for teachers and students, and an effective calender.  We believe these goals are achievable with the above selected dev tools that we will use during this project.  


-------            Setup Guide              --------
For the time being we have a url at "https://easel-team-beta-350.herokuapp.com/" that will load our Hello World app.  This page is hosted by Heroku and is setup by django.  


-------        Create "Hello World"         --------
As said above our "Hello World" page can be found at "https://easel-team-beta-350.herokuapp.com/".  This page was build through django and HTML, and the files that are included with it can be found in our github repo under ~/project/templates/home.html.


-------      Decide on App deployment       --------
Our app will be hosted by Heroku, because of the easy to use tools that Heroku employs. Heroku will allow us to host our own app, along  with being able to test our project in a live page.  Heroku will also show us details on the app, and allow us to better implement in-app features later on in the project development.
