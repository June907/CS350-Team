Milestone 1. Project Plan Complete
Role: Project Manager - Requirements

-- EASEL - PROJECT CHARTER --

Easel is a software application that runs in the cloud. Users can use this application similarly to Canvas, which allows for the creation of classess and assignments, quizzes, and exams within those classes in order to create a seamless, integrated gradebook.

Chat between classmates and share files--collaboration is key for academic success.

-- Business Proposition --

Client: Mark Seaman has contracted The Boysâ„¢ in order to create an application that will manage grades and assignments in a manner similar to Canvas.

Author Value: Create, using complex database structures, an easy-to-use application that not only replicates Canvas' best aspects, but improves on some of its more overlooked features.

Business Value: With online schooling, an application like this would introduce another competitor into the market and inspire competition. This will allow students to thrive without the bounds of technology keeping them down.

-- Project Scope and Budget --

Easel's Priorities:

    - Schedule: This entire project must be completed by December 4, 2020 in order to be submitted for credit to CS 350.
    - Money: This project will be the group effort, and considering all of the participants are students, it's hard to estimate the opportunity cost of a project such as this. For all intents and purposes, consider this slave labor for GPA.
    - Features: Two tiers of features should suffice; those that are absolutely necessary for the satisfactory completion of the project (assignments, grades, classes, etc), while others (chat, file sharing) are discretionary and will only be completed when we can ensure the successful completion of the necessities.

Features will be adjusted throughout the milestone and must be constantly negotiated with the client.

Project Features:

    - Class -> Student Structure: This project will be organized similarly to Canvas in order to maximize search efficiency. Classess will enroll students and store assignments, which a student will create a new instance of tailored specifically to how they perform. That grade is stored and helps to calculate their GPA, while teachers can adjust the balance on specific.
    - File Sharing: In order to submit many assignments, a file of certain type is needed. The process for doing so should be seamess and easy to understand for even the most technically illiterate.
    - Chat: Ability to create discussion/chats boards within and outside classes in order to inspire collaboration between students.
    
-- Our Team --

Development Team (First Rotation):

    - Erik Halenkamp - Requirements
    - Yusuf Kortobi - Design
    - Junwen Huang - Code
    - Asepha Shaeffer - Test

Communication Plan:

The dev team is participating in online classes, so little to no in-person contact will be asked of them. They are communicating regularly between classes through Discord, an online chatting app, and Zoom.

The team generally meets for a few moments MWF after each class lecture session of CS 350.

Meeting Agenda:

Discussion will generally pertain to what was said in lecture that day, as well as an affirmation of each developer's progress towards the development milestone for that week.

Sprints:

During the development process, milestones have been placed to inspire sprints, or bursts of energy, in order to meet the requirement goals laid out for that period. Each spring will last for two weeks. After each milestone, team members will give feedback about the team dynamics they experienced. A brief survey will show how the team is working together. The results of this survey will be recorded as part of the public record for Easel. Until otherwise instructed, these milestones will be shared with Mark Seaman.
