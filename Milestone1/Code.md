Goal: Version control

Canvas Gradebook -Version control

All code for Canvas Gradebook lives in git repos at Github. This includes the application source code, the documents for development, and the customer website used for marketing. Each team member will have their own GitHub repository for this project and I created a CS350-Team repository for our team, the application source code will be published in the team repository.

Setup Github account

We all have our own GitHub account, we will use it to store our code and we will push our code to GitHub after we tested.

Setup Github Pages repository

The Canvas Grade Book client website will be built so that the automatic publishing of Github Pages will make it publicly available. To avoid any additional setup we will be using the existing Github Pages in the repo at "https://github.com/June907/CS350-Team".

The customer website will be located at https://secret-refuge-89836.herokuapp.com/.

Decide how to publish your project docs

As I mentioned before, each team member will have their own GitHub account and repository for this application, they will be using their repository when they are coding until they make sure their code works then they will be published into the team repository that I created, all the team member has access to CS350-Team repository. I have set up a repo with all my teammates as my collaborators.


The Github Repo holds the Book Builder Documents

User Guide for development workflow
We will have a readMe.txt in our GitHub team repository, we will post what we did in the readMe.txt also we will post what are we going to update next in our application as we progress.
